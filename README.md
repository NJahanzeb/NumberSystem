<h1>Number System Converter</h1>

<p>A number system is a method of representing numbers. The most commonly used number system in our daily lives is the decimal number system, which has a base of 10 and uses digits from 0 to 9. In the decimal system, the positions to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on.</p>

<p>There are other frequently used number systems, such as the base-16 (hexadecimal), base-8 (octal), and base-2 (binary) systems. Computers, which understand only numbers, translate letters and words into numbers.</p>

<p>Computers comprehend positional number systems, where a limited set of symbols called digits represents different values based on their position within the number. To determine the value of each digit in a number, you need to consider the digit itself, its position in the number, and the base of the number system (which refers to the total number of digits available).</p>

<p>As a computer programmer or IT professional, it is essential to understand the following number systems commonly used in computers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binary Number System:</strong><br>
Base 2. Digits used: 0, 1.</li>

<li><strong>Octal Number System:</strong><br>
Base 8. Digits used: 0 to 7.</li>

<li><strong>Decimal Number System:</strong><br>
Base 10. Digits used: 0 to 9.</li>

<li><strong>Hexadecimal Number System:</strong><br>
Base 16. Digits used: 0 to 9, Letters used: A-F.</li>
</ul>

<p>A. Develop a class hierarchy in C++ with "Number System" as the base class and four derived classes representing each of the four mentioned number systems. Utilize this class hierarchy to create a "Number Conversion Calculator."</p>

<p>B. The calculator should offer the following functionalities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert a number (in any of the four bases) to a specified base</li>
<li>Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on numbers (in any of the four bases) using operator overloading</li>
</ol>

<p>C. Create a UML Class Diagram for the class hierarchy and provide sample program outputs.</p>
